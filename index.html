                    I learned from the article that website pages are responsive, and 
                    their content layout adapts to the size of the window, ensuring that 
                    it utilizes the entire screen real estate efficiently. These web pages 
                    primarily follow a vertical layout, stacking elements on top of each 
                    other, which maintains design consistency regardless of screen size. 
                    Various file types, such as images, videos, and audio, can seamlessly 
                    integrate into the page. Readers can effortlessly navigate the entire 
                    content with a simple swipe of the mouse.
                    <br>
                    The article also highlights that in web design, the possibilities for 
                    page layout are virtually limitless. The author provides many visual 
                    examples to illustrate the boundless nature of web page design. To 
                    effectively plan the layout of the web page, we need to combine elements 
                    to fit in with the web space. During the process of designing a web page 
                    I often face a situation where the layout of the elements is confusing. 
                    This is because I have not adjusted the proportion and structure between 
                    the elements on the web page.

                    Before I began to practice, mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.
                    <br>
                    After I began to practice, mountains were no longer mountains and rivers were no longer rivers.

                    Elements get stacked like a layer cake by default, and it make sense—vertical 
                    stacks are much easier to adapt across all kinds of screen sizes, because you don’t 
                    have layout issues to manage with more or less space across.

                    It is an edgeless surface of unknown proportions, comprised of small, individual, and variable 
                    elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment.
